## :dart: *Project’s Goal:*

### *Finding a solution for the parking problem in big cities.*
*Clients can pay in advanced for a private parking spot of an individual who lives in that city,*
*that way the parking spot owner benefits from renting his spot when it’s empty and the lessee gets a decent parking spot with minimum time waste, costs and effort.*



## :large_blue_diamond: *Introduction:*

*The business model of ParkSaver company is based on the “Joined Economics" principal. The company produces a cellphone application that allows*
*communication between drivers and parking spots owners. These days, there’s a lack of parking spots and their costs are extremely high.*
*When a person is traveling for a meeting, concert and so on he might have to pay a huge amount of money and waste time for finding a decent parking spot.*
*We would like to make it easier for individuals to search for parking places.*

### *The project's objectives are:*

* *Parking spot owner can rent out his spot in specific hours he chooses to, therefore gain an income.*
  *In addition, there will be less road congestion and the cost of public parking lots will decrease.*

* *The lessee will receive a comfortable solution for finding a decent parking spot and will save money and precious time in the process.*



## :triangular_ruler: *Design Considerations:*

*With the ParkSaver application, each owner of a parking spot can publicize it, showing up on our map.*
*In such way, drivers can look for the closest parking spot, rent it and pay for it through the app,*
*the price for the parking spot will be displayed on the map. In addition, we manage a user’s rating system*
*that provides motivation for fitting behavior of the renters and the lessees.*

### *The algorithm is based on 3 components:*
* *Shortest route from the desired destination.*
* *The cost of the parking spot.*
* *Ratings of the parking spot owner.*



## :bar_chart: *Selected Approach:*

*Our main mission was to enable easy access between lessee and owner - renting or leasing a parking spot.*
*That's why we chose to develop an app that anyone can always carry with in his pocket.*
*The app is GPS based - when the user looks for a parking spot, it offers him a cheap close one,*
*including details of cost and the relevant hours, everything in one application.*
